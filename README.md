# OneLifeSMP
A simple Server-side Fabric Mod, madeby TwilightZebby for [Dr1fterX's](https://www.twitch.tv/dr1fterx) OneLife Survival Streams because it seemed like the Fabric ecosystem had yet to produce a Server-side 1.18.1 mod which also included ` /smite` command!

But hey, at least it gave TwilightZebby a chance to further his Java knowledge and step into the world of Minecraft: Java Edition Modding! :D

## Commands

| Command         | Access Level | Description                          |
